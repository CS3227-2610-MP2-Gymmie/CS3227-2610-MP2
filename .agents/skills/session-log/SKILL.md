# Session Log

Use this skill when the user wants the current session summarized and recorded as a log. Read the whole available conversation context first, then capture the important interactions and decisions rather than repeating every turn.

Create exactly one file at `logs/<github-user>/<NNN>-<session-name>.md` in the current repository:

- Run `gh api user --jq .login` to determine `<github-user>` unless the user explicitly provides a GitHub username.
- If the user is unauthenticated, explain the problem and provide the user with the recovery commands before stopping:
  ```sh
  gh auth status
  gh auth login --hostname github.com --web
  gh api user --jq .login
  ```
- If the command fails for other reasons, explain the issue and provide the user with the relevant fix before stopping. Let the user know they can provide their GitHub username explicitly instead of using the command to determine it.
- If the user explicitly provides a GitHub username, use it as user-provided attribution instead of using the command.
- Inspect only that user's `logs/<github-user>/` directory and choose the next unused three-digit number. Start at `001` when the directory has no numbered logs.
- Use a concise 3–6 word kebab-case `<session-name>` describing the session.
- Keep the log under 500 words.
- Omit the current log file itself from the `## Files created or modified` section.
- Do not modify unrelated files, and do not commit.
- If no files were created or modified during the session, state that explicitly under the `## Files created or modified` section. 

Use this exact structure:

```markdown
# Session Title

## Goal
One or two sentences on what the session set out to do.

## Scope
One line on the number of user-assistant exchanges and whether the session was one focused task or several unrelated tasks.

## Key prompts
The 2–5 instructions that materially shaped the work, quoted in the user's own wording, each followed by a sentence explaining what it asked for and why it was framed that way. Omit routine follow-ups, approvals, and clarifications.

## Decisions and corrections
Every important user decision, disagreement, rejected tool call, or correction and redo. Be specific where needed.

## Files created or modified
- File 1
- File 2
```
